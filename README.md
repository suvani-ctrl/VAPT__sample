## üîç Attack Narrative

### Reconnaissance
The reconnaissance phase involved gathering critical information about the target system. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques and automated tools were utilized to collect valuable data that helped in understanding the target‚Äôs attack surface.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities
After the reconnaissance phase, vulnerability scanning tools like Nessus and Burp Suite were employed to identify weaknesses. Manual testing was also performed to find logic flaws and misconfigurations. Key vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and outdated software versions were discovered.

### Setting up the environment
To ensure safe and controlled testing, a simulated environment replicating the production system was set up. This setup allowed for testing without any risk of impacting the live system.

### Submodule Addition
Additional submodules were incorporated to enhance the overall testing capabilities, ensuring that all layers of the target infrastructure were thoroughly assessed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation

### Getting Access
After identifying vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques were employed to gain unauthorized access. A combination of tools like Metasploit and custom scripts were used to exploit vulnerabilities, allowing us to gain access to the system.

---

## üìù SCOPE
This engagement was carried out with explicit written permission from the organization. The scope covered the target's web applications, network infrastructure, and related components to identify any security weaknesses.

---

## üß∞ Methodologies and Standards

The testing was conducted using widely recognized standards such as the OWASP Top 10, NIST 800-115, and the PTES framework. The methodology followed was based on real-world attack patterns, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.
